# TeamDAlarmClock

Team members: Christian Howe, Wyatt Lawrence, Evan Mitchell, Colin Ferguson

Overview: This application gives the user access to an alarm clock, timer, stopwatch, and updated weather forecast with a text-to-speech option

Recommended settings: Java SDK 12.0.0 and JavaFX 11.0.2. Very often, when we pushed or pulled, we had to reset the SDK and the library.

Additional notes: Start the program with MainAlarmUI. Make sure the project folder is named "TeamDAlarmClock". The Weather API this program utilizes is from AccuWeather and allows for no more than 50 calls per day, and updates approximately once per hour. Any classes that are ingrained into the UI such as the Timer, Snooze, and Stopwatch classes are untestable. However, we do have tests for the basic mechanics of those classes.
